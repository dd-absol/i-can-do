# Advent of code 2022 in Elixir

I did this one after having worked on Haskell, in the realization that, as cool and functionnal as Haskell was, it was kinda hard to find uses and frameworks for it. I went a little farther but got tired of the maths and moved on as well. I hope I'll be able to add actual useful elixir projects soon because I really enjoy the language (sorry Haskell, you're too cool for me I guess).

I set up custom mix tasks to run the day 2, you can just run `mix day 2` and so on. 
(I did not optimize the part 2 of day 17, so try at your own risk.)
