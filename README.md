# i-can-do
a compilation of projects that say "I can do x, I can do y"

I created this repo with the goal of better documenting my learnings, abilities and progress. 
My vision is to create a way to better sell myself, but also to gather useful knowledge, problems and techniques in one place.

The languages featured here for now are:
- Rust
- Haskell
- Elixir

More languages that are not featured but that "I can" definitely "do":

I love to explore different and fun(ctional) languages in my free time. I was introduced to functional programming during my first actual computer science classes with OCaml, a language that I have proceeded to never use again outside of those, and that I have written more lines of on paper than in an actual editor, but that I'll mention here because I still love it to this day.

I do also work with C# and JS at my current 6-months internship, and definitely have more professionnal experience with those two than the rest, sorry if it is not documented too well here.

I also used Python for most of my school projects, as it is the language of choice when studying engineering as a whole in France, because of the many mathematic libraries and applications and the simple beginner friendly syntax. I have however chosen to not put any Python here because I have grown to not like the language and would never deliberately choose it for a personal project.
