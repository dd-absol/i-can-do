# i-can-do
a compilation of projects that say "I can do x, I can do y"

I created this repo with the goal of better document my learnings, abilities and progress. 
My vision is to create not only a way to better sell myself, but also to gather useful knowledge, problems and techniques in one place.

The languages featured here for now are:
- Rust
- Haskell
- Elixir

I love to explore different and fun languages in my free time, but I do also work with C# and JS at my current internship, and probably definitely have more professionnal experience with those two than the rest, sorry if it is not documented too well here
