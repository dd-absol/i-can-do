# My introduction to advent of code, and I  chose Haskell...

Haskell is fun! Back when I worked on this I ran them with the `runhaskell` command for convenience but I just learned it was slower than compiling, so you can do whatever haha, all the files are independent and solve a single problem. 
I gave up at 15, 16, 17 because it was getting a bit mathy and tedious, and I was having trouble with using haskell packages, which are needed for Arrays which I was told are not native to the languagee (how sad)
